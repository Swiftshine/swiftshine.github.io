I'm Swiftshine. This is my website. That's all you need to know.

Should I put something more interesting here? Dunno.

## What are your skills?
__Programming__

* Python
* PowerPC
* ARM

__Misc__
* (decent) video editing
* maybe some other things if I can think of them

## What are you known for?
I don't think I'm notable in any capacity. Maybe you've seen me around, maybe you haven't. But hey, I guess I'm interesting enough for you to have seen this page?

## I wanna contact you!
I don't know why you'd want to do that, but my Discord is `@swiftshine`. Feel free to ask questions you think I'm competent enough to answer. Don't expect small talk.

## Will you help me with (project)?
No. Well, maybe if you say 'pretty please'.
